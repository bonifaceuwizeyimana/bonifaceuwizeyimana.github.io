excerpt: 'Abstract:
The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into wireless networks is gaining significant attention in the fifth generation (5G) and beyond technologies. The use of UAVs has the potential of expanding coverage and providing efficient and reliable communication services, especially in remote and inaccessible areas. While other studies have explored sum-rate maximization via user pairing considering a multi-armed bandit (MAB) for a single UAV, the use of MAB in multiple UAVs especially under non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is not fully explored. This paper presents an algorithm for user pairing targeting sum-rate maximization of multi-UAV NOMA networks by applying multi-agent bandits that employ two-sided matching. The proposed method performs user association and power allocation with no coordination among the UAVs. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method which is very close to that achieved by exhaustive search and outperforms random matching.'
